This is an unofficial update of NaK1119's outstanding (and currently abandoned) [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1500853272.7]"Crisis Manager - Total War Pack"[/url] mod to Stellaris version 2.2.7.*. 

Compared to NaK1119's final release, this version adds numerous tweaks and changes to bring it in line with vanilla updates. The alterations needed to bring this mod up-to-date were comparably minor, and there are unlikely to be any bugs introduced from the version change. That said, I haven't really been able to playtest it much; please let me know if you run into any issues.

[h1]Original Description[/h1]
[h2]--------------------------------[/h2]

[h2]Summary[/h2]
Vanilla expansion of end-game crises is typically very slow, in part because of their slow construction of starbases. If this mod is applied, starbases of end-game and Horde crisis factions are created without construction ships when they conquer systems (much like how Total Wars work vs. purifier factions). Crisis will also be able to automatically build starbases in unclaimed systems as soon as a military ship of theirs enters the system. This results in a much faster expansion time, and more dangerous crises overall.

[h2]Install/Uninstall for Saved Game[/h2]
This mod can be installed/uninstalled anytime, even if any crisis is ongoing.

[h2]Features[/h2]
Endgame crisis factions and the Khan's horde are changed to follow total war rules for starbase control:
[list]
[*]Crisis factions will automatically gain control of/build starbases in systems upon defeating them.
[*]Player and AI empires will automatically gain outposts in systems upon destroying crisis starbases.
[*]All claims upon systems will lapse upon ownership transfer (this is an unavoidable limitation, unfortunately)
[/list]
Additionally, crisis factions will immediately construct starbases in unowned systems when they enter them with construction ships or military fleets.

Note that none of the above changes impact the Grey Tempest, as that crisis faction does not build starbases.
