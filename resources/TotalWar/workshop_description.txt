This is an unofficial update of NaK1119's outstanding [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1500853272.7]"Crisis Manager - Total War Pack"[/url] mod to Stellaris version 2.7.*. 

The Unofficial Crisis Managers are an ongoing, [url=https://github.com/TehFishey/stellaris-crisis-managers]open-source project[/url]. There's a lot of work to be done on them, and current events have left me with less time to do it on than I'd like. If you'd like to contribute, or help with bugfixing, code maintainence, or localization/translation, please don't hesitate to PM me or leave a comment!

[h1]Detailed Description[/h1]
[h2]--------------------------------[/h2]

[h2]Summary[/h2]
Vanilla expansion of end-game crises is typically very slow, in part because of their slow construction of starbases. If this mod is applied, starbases of end-game and Horde crisis factions are created without construction ships when they conquer systems (much like how Total Wars work vs. purifier factions). Crisis will also be able to automatically build starbases in unclaimed systems as soon as a military ship of theirs enters the system. This results in a much faster expansion time, and more dangerous crises overall.

[h2]Features[/h2]
Endgame crisis factions and the Khan's horde are changed to follow total war rules for starbase control:
[list]
[*]Crisis factions will automatically gain control of/build starbases in systems upon defeating them.
[*]Player and AI empires will automatically gain outposts in systems upon destroying crisis starbases.
[*]All claims upon systems will lapse upon ownership transfer (this is an unavoidable limitation, unfortunately)
[/list]
Additionally, crisis factions will immediately construct starbases in unowned systems when they enter them with construction ships or military fleets.

Note that none of the above changes impact the Grey Tempest, as that crisis faction does not build starbases.

[h2]Installation & Uninstallation[/h2]
This mod can be installed/uninstalled anytime, even if any crisis is ongoing.
