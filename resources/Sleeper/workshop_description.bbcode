This mod provides in-game tools for customizing for the War in Heaven and Fallen Empire Awakening events. Among other things, it provides options to make Fallen Empires stronger or weaker, to make them awaken faster or slower, to make the War in Heaven more or less likely, and so on. Note that Guardian of the Galaxy events are not direct controlled by this mod, and are instead managed by the [url=//steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2558262194]End-Game Edition[/url].

Although this is a sub-mod of the [b]End-Game Edition[/b], this mod works as a [b]standalone[/b] as well (though the configuration menu might be a little more awkward to use).

The menu can be accessed in-game through your choice of [url=//steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=1087781345]!Mod Menu[/url], [url=//steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2458024521]Dynamic Mod Menu[/url], or the [url=//steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=2466607238]Infinite Core Framework[/url].
