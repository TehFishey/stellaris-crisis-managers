This is an unofficial update of NaK1119's outstanding [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1439935827]"Crisis Manager - Sleeper Edition"[/url] mod to Stellaris version 2.7.*. 

The Unofficial Crisis Managers are an ongoing, [url=https://github.com/TehFishey/stellaris-crisis-managers]open-source project[/url]. There's a lot of work to be done on them, and current events have left me with less time to do it on than I'd like. If you'd like to contribute, or help with bugfixing, code maintainence, or localization/translation, please don't hesitate to PM me or leave a comment!

Given the complexity of this mod, not all of its features have been fully tested in the latest versions of the game. If you come across any bugs, please report them either in the comments below or on GitHub.

[h1]Detailed Description[/h1]
[h2]--------------------------------[/h2]

[h2]Summary[/h2]
This mod provides in-game tools for customizing Fallen Empire Awakening events and the War in Heaven. Among other things, it provides options to make Fallen Empires stronger or weaker, to make them Awaken faster or slower, to make the War in Heaven more or less likely, and so on. Note that Guardian of the Galaxy events are not controlled by this mod, and are instead managed by the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2030057100]End-Game edition[/url].

Although this is sub-mod of the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2030057100]End-Game Edition[/url], this mod works as a standalone as well (though the configuration menu might be a little more awkward to use). The menu can be accessed in-game through your choice of [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=1087781345]!Mod Menu[/url], [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1840010432]Dynamic Mod Menu[/url], or the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=1943060017]!! 00 Infinite Stellaris Framework[/url] (Thanks 小傘INFINI7E!). 

[h2]Features[/h2]
Players can access the following options via an in-game menu:
[list]
[*]Configurations for the timings, triggers, and probabilities of FE Awakenings and the War in Heaven.
[*]Configurations for the conditions and probabilities for NPC empires joining the League of Non-Aligned Powers.
[*]Configurations for the war exhaustion mechanic in the War in Heaven.
[*]And more!
[/list]

Several preset templates for all of the above settings are included with the End-Game Crisis Manager mod. Additionally, user-designed template presets can be built as custom mods/addons; instructions for doing so can be found in the End-Game Crisis Manager's directory.

[h2]Installation & Uninstallation[/h2]
This mod should only be installed (or uninstalled) for games where NO end-game crisis or fallen empire awakening events have been triggered.

[h2]Localization & Languages[/h2]
[list]
[*]English localization needs some editing/re-writing, but is available (obviously).
[*]русские переводы завершены! Спасибо Аргокон Эстейл!
[*]已添加中文翻译。 -Lunar Traveller
