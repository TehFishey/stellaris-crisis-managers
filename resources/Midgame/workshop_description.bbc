[h2]Summary[/h2]
This mod provides in-game tools for customizing mid-game crisis events, such as the Rise of the Great Khan and several events related to L-Gates. Among other things, it provides options to make these crises more powerful or weaker, to make them happen sooner or happen later, and to alter the probabilities of random events/outcomes (such as what happens after the L-Cluster is opened or after the Great Khan dies).

Although this is sub-mod of the [url=//steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/2558262194]End-Game Edition[/url], this mod works as a standalone as well (though the configuration menu might be a little more awkward to use).

This mod comes with a default configuration template; more are available if you're using the [b]End-Game Edition[/b] alongside it.

This [i]Crisis Managers[/i] and companion mods (like [url=//steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/2577705378]Sleeper Edition[/url]) are kept separate for comparability reasons, but will be merged in the future. [strike]If you're looking for even more challenge, consider adding the (standalone) [url=//steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/2038763403]Total War Pack[/url] to your game as well.[/strike]

[h3]⚹ Important Note[/h3]
The deadline for setting parameters of L-Gate events comes much sooner than those for the other crises. Specifically, these settings can only be changed until any empire (AI or player) finds a Gateway or L-Gate. It's strongly advised that you set these parameters at the start of the game.

[h3]Requirements[/h3]
[b]The menu[/b] can be accessed in-game through your choice of [url=//steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/1087781345]Mod Menu[/url], [url=//steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/2458024521]Dynamic Mod Menu[/url], or the [url=//steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/2466607238]Infinite Core Framework[/url]![spoiler] If not, you can run it using the console command: 'event CrisisManagerMenu.100'[/spoiler]

[h1]Features[/h1]
Players can access the following options via an in-game menu:[list][*]Configurations for the timings, potential triggers, and fleet power for the Great Khan event chain.
[*]Settings for changing the number of times the Khan can reincarnate, and enabling reigning of multiple Great Khans.
[*]Configurations for what is able to happen after the Great Khan dies.
[*]Configurations for the requirements and potential outcomes for opening the L-Gates.
[*]Configurations for the fleet power and capabilities of the various entities that may spawn from the L-Gates.
[*]Options to manually trigger L-Gate opening and the Great Khan's rise, and to end their related crises.
[*]Options for manually adding or removing L-Gates (Warning: this can be UNSTABLE).
[*]More things…[/list]

Several preset templates for all of the above settings are included with the End-Game Crisis Manager mod. Additionally, user-designed template presets can be built as custom mods/addons; instructions for doing so can be found in the End-Game Crisis Manager's directory.

[h2]Installation / Uninstallation[/h2]

• Gray Tempest is NOT ongoing
• The Dessanu (an empire that might spawn from the L-Gates) do NOT exist

[h3]To-Do / Planned[/h3]
[strike]• Can manually spawn the Gray Tempest/Dessanu even if one of the other already exists.[/strike] (partial hidden beta in, actually proper only with ADT)
[strike]• Can manually spawn different L-Cluster outcomes even if an outcome had already spawned.[/strike] (partial hidden beta in)
• Performance: reduce wastage of unnecessary new variable names (steadily in progress).

[hr]• Previous version [url=//steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/2033764043]Crisis Manager – Mid-Game Edition [Unofficial] Legacy[/url]  (2.7) adopted by TehFishey • [url=//github.com/TehFishey/stellaris-crisis-managers/releases/tag/3.0.4]3.0.* (GitHub)[/url]
