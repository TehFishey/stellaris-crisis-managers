Note that given the complexity of this mod, not all features have been fully tested in the latest versions. If you come across any bugs, please report them either in the comments below or on GitHub.

[h2]Summary[/h2]
This mod provides in-game tools for customizing mid-game crisis events, such as the Rise of the Great Khan and several events related to L-Gates. Among other things, it provides options to make these crises more powerful or weaker, to make them happen sooner or happen later, and to alter the probabilities of random events/outcomes (such as what happens after the L-Cluster is opened or after the Great Khan dies).

Although this is sub-mod of the [url=//steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2558262194]End-Game Edition (3.0)[/url], this mod works as a standalone as well (though the configuration menu might be a little more awkward to use). The menu can be accessed in-game through your choice of [url=//steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=1087781345]Mod Menu[/url], [url=//steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2458024521]Dynamic Mod Menu 3.0[/url], or the [url=//steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=2466607238]Infinite Core Framework & Modmenu 3.0[/url]!

This mod comes with a default configuration template; more are available if you're using the [b]End-Game Edition[/b] alongside it.

This [i]Crisis Managers[/i] and companion mods (like [url=//steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=2577705378]Sleeper Edition[/url]) are kept separate for comparability reasons, but will be merged in the future. [strike]If you're looking for even more challenge, consider adding the (standalone) [url=//steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=2038763403]Total War Pack[/url] to your game as well.[/strike]

[h3]⚹ Important Note[/h3]
The deadline for setting parameters of L-Gate events comes much sooner than those for the other crises. Specifically, these settings can only be changed until any empire (AI or player) finds a Gateway or L-Gate. It's strongly advised that you set these parameters at the start of the game.

[h1]Features[/h1]
Players can access the following options via an in-game menu:[list][*]Configurations for the timings, potential triggers, and fleet power for the Great Khan event chain.
[*]Settings for changing the number of times the Khan can reincarnate, and enabling reigning of multiple Great Khans.
[*]Configurations for what is able to happen after the Great Khan dies.
[*]Configurations for the requirements and potential outcomes for opening the L-Gates.
[*]Configurations for the fleet power and capabilities of the various entities that may spawn from the L-Gates.
[*]Options to manually trigger L-Gate opening and the Great Khan's rise, and to end their related crises.
[*]Options for manually adding or removing L-Gates (Warning: this can be UNSTABLE).
[*]More things…[/list]

Several preset templates for all of the above settings are included with the End-Game Crisis Manager mod. Additionally, user-designed template presets can be built as custom mods/addons; instructions for doing so can be found in the End-Game Crisis Manager's directory.

[h2]Installation / Uninstallation[/h2]
This mod should be installed for new games (but still works, just with less functionality).
This mod can be uninstalled safely only when all of following conditions are satisfied (uninstall function is planned):
• Horde Crisis is NOT ongoing
• Gray Tempest is NOT ongoing
• The Dessanu (an empire that might spawn from the L-Gates) do NOT exist

[h3]To-Do / Planned[/h3]
• Can manually spawn different L-Cluster outcomes even if an outcome had already spawned.
• Can manually spawn the Gray Tempest/Dessanu even if one of the other already exists.
• Performance: reduce wastage of unnecessary new variable names (steadily in progress).
