This is an unofficial update of NaK1119's outstanding (and currently abandoned) [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1535853501]"Crisis Manager - Player Crisis Pack"[/url] mod to Stellaris version 2.7.*. 

The Unofficial Crisis Managers are an ongoing, [url=https://github.com/TehFishey/stellaris-crisis-managers]open-source project[/url]. There's a lot of work to be done on them, and current events have left me with less time to do it on than I'd like. If you'd like to contribute, or help with bugfixing, code maintainence, or localization/translation, please don't hesitate to PM me or leave a comment!

[b]This mod is currently in an UNSTABLE RELEASE STATE.[/b] While it is not broken per se, I have not yet had a chance to overhaul its functionality to make sense with the latest diplomacy updates in Federations, potentially resulting in some very strange and unintuitive behaviors.

[h1]Detailed Description[/h1]
[h2]--------------------------------[/h2]

[h2]Summary[/h2]
This mod allows player empires to become a kind of pseudo-crisis faction, by declaring unending total wars on all empires at once in a bid to bring an end to the galaxy. This feature can be triggered from the Crisis Manager menu or an edict; it declares a war on all other empires in which no war exhaustion is accumulated, and mercy is not an option.

This mod is independent from the other Crisis Manager mods, though they can be used together if you'd like.

[h2]Features[/h2]
An edict of "Liquidation of the Galaxy" will be available if all of following conditions are satisfied:
[list]
[*]Passes End-Game Start Year
[*]Has enough fleet power.
[*]Equivalent to or stronger than all fallen/awakened empires.
[*]Superior or overwhelming to other all empires.
[*]Controlled by human player, but not AI.
[*]Is independent empire
[*]Does NOT form federation.
[*]Is NOT at a war now.
[/list]
(If the above conditions are not met, you can still manually trigger the player crisis from the Crisis Manager menu if you are using any of that series' main components)

The player crisis war will have the following features:
[list]
[*]Enemies[list]
[*]All standard/fallen/awakened empires will be your enemies.
[*]All your subjects will be released soon and join war as ENEMIES.
[*]Space creatures, enclaves and everything else will be also hostile to you.[/list]
[*]Rules of War[list]
[*]A peace of Status Quo is NEVER made. The war continues until one side is completely destroyed.
[*]This is total war. Ownership of starbases defeated in space combat is transfered immediately.[/list]
[*]Others[list]
[*]An orbital bombardment stronger than Armageddon is unlocked.
[*]Some of policies are allowed and/or forced.
[*]All deals with enclaves are cancelled immediately.
[*]The faction of pacifist will displease permanently because of the endless war.[/list]
[/list]
Let's ruin the galaxy substitute for feckless Prethoryn, extradimensionals and the Contingency.

[h2]Installation & Uninstallation[/h2]
This mod can be installed for any save data, and be uninstalled only save data that the total war added by this mod has NOT happened or been triggered.

[h2]Localization & Languages[/h2]
[list]
[*]English localization needs some editing/re-writing, but is available (obviously).
[*]已添加中文翻译。 -Lunar Traveller

[h2]Compatibility Information[/h2]
This mod overwrites armageddon (bombardment), and some of vanilla policies and so on.
This may cause relatively slight compatibility issues with mods that interact with the same, though any issues would likely not be critical.
