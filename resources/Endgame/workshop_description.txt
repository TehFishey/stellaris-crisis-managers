This is an unofficial update of NaK1119's outstanding (and currently abandoned) [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1400722.7514]"Crisis Manager - End-Game Edition"[/url] mod to Stellaris version 2.2.7.*. 

Compared to NaK1119's final release, this version adds:
[list]
[*]Numerous tweaks, changes, and bugfixes from vanilla updates.
[*]Compatibility/accessibility with [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1840010432]Dynamic Mod Menu[/url]. Compatibility with [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=1087781345]!Mod Menu[/url] is retained. [b]You only need one of these menu mods, not both.[/b]
[*]A few minor changes to fix vanilla bugs with crisis purging and behavior.
[/list]

Everything seems to work in Federations now; given the complexity of this mod, however, I haven't been able to fully test all of its features. If anyone comes across any bugs, let me know and I can try to fix them as time allows.
