This is an unofficial update of NaK1119's outstanding (and currently abandoned) [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1491711756]"Crisis Manager - Mid-Game Edition"[/url] mod to Stellaris version 2.6.*. 

Compared to NaK1119's final release, this version adds:
[list]
[*]A few tweaks, changes, and bugfixes from vanilla updates (See changelog for complete list).
[*]Changed the configuration options and templates for Awakening fleet-power trigger thresholds to bring them in line with current vanilla values.
[*]Updated all templates, menus, and localization to account for the above changes.
[*]Overhauled War in Heaven event chain to properly employ new vanilla behaviors and Federations content.
[*]Compatibility/accessibility with [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1840010432]Dynamic Mod Menu[/url]. Compatibility with [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=1087781345]!Mod Menu[/url] is retained. [b]You only need one of these menu mods, not both.[/b]
[/list]

This update required significant changes be made to some of the Crisis Manager's internal events and overrides; as such, I would consider it a 'Beta' version right now. Please report any bugs, issues, or odd behaviors that you come across - especially ones related to the formation of the League of Unaligned Powers.

[h1]Original Description[/h1]
[h2]--------------------------------[/h2]

[h2]Summary[/h2]
This mod is a tool for customizing awakening events of fallen empires including the War in Heaven.
For example, timing of F.E. Awakening, a probability of the War in Heaven, a probability of subjection at the War in Heaven, etc. The Guardians of the Galaxy events are not controlled by this mid, and are instead handled by the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2030057100]End-Game edition[/url].

Although this is sub-mod of the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2030057100]End-Game Edition[/url], this mod works as a standalone as well (though the configuration menu might be a little more awkward to use).
The configuration menu can be accessed in-game either through [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=1087781345]!Mod Menu[/url] or [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1840010432]Dynamic Mod Menu[/url]. This mod comes with a default configuration template; more are available if you're using the End-Game Edition alongside it.

[h2]Install/Uninstall for Saved Game[/h2]
This mod can be installed/uninstalled for only save data that any end-game crisis or awakening of fallen empires have NOT happened or been triggered.

[h2]Features[/h2]
Players can access the following options via an in-game menu:
[list]
[*]Configurations for the timings, triggers, and probabilities of FE Awakenings and the War in Heaven.
[*]Configurations for the conditions and probabilities for NPC empires joining the League of Non-Aligned Powers.
[*]Configurations for the war exhaustion mechanic in the War in Heaven.
[*]And more!
